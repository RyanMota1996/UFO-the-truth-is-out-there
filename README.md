# UFO-the-truth-is-out-there

## Purpose
make a web app using java to display ufo data on a small Oregon town that has a lot strange sitings. Furthermore the site is also able to easily filtered and navigated through. 

## Description/Results
to use the webapp you must search via several listed categories such as state, city, type and so on.

## Summary 
webapp is difficult to update or add info to without going into java file and manually adding the data, furthermore this has to be done each time someone wants to add information to the data set, so that it can be as up to date as possible. A recommendation to make the webapp as streamline as possible is by buying a domain to host the website and data use a online database, and a 'report sitings' option.
